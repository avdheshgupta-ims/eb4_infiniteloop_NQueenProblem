<b> Experiment|     <b> 3. N Queen Problem

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

1.To learn the importance of designing an algorithm in an effective way by considering space and time complexity
2.To learn graph search algorithms.
3.To study network flow and linear programming problems
4.To learn the dynamic programming design techniques.
5.To develop recursive backtracking algorithms.


<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

N QUEEN USING BACKTRACKING
This problem is to find an arrangement of N queens on a chess board, such that no queen can attack any other queens on the board.The chess queens can attack in any direction as horizontal, vertical, horizontal and diagonal way.A binary matrix is used to display the positions of N Queens, where no queens can attack other queens
Time complexity
The algorithm can be used to solve an N queen problem the time complexity of the problem is 
WORST CASE – O(N!)
AVERAGE CASE – O(N!)

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

•	Students learning KCS553 and other potential learner.
