#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> The user will learn and examine the problem, recall the understanding and apply to fix the place of queens in such a way that no queen attack each other.  Simulator:
 </u>
<br>
  1.	First, start placing queen anywhere on the board and then place the next queen in any of the safe place as queen can attack horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  2.	Then continue until no safe place left. If no safe place is left, then backtracking the problem  and   to change the position of the previous queen and continue the same process.
