#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Reinforce theoretical concepts: The user understands topics after seeing the simulator visually, and learn/recall their knowledge
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> The user will learn and examine the problem, recall the understanding and apply to fix the place of queens in such a way that no queen attack each other. <br> <b>Simulator:</b>
 </u>
<br>
  1.	First, start placing queen anywhere on the board and then place the next queen in any of the safe place as queen can attack horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  2.	Then continue until no safe place left. If no safe place is left, then backtracking the problem  and   to change the position of the previous queen and continue the same process.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Click on Simulation button | Simulation page display and speed of simulation, size of checker board and manual/auto options. | to show the requiremnt of simulation
2.| Click on Auto or manual/ adjust the Speed of simulator, adjust the size of chekerboard	 | In auto mode, the simulator find all possible solutions, speed ajust the simulation speed, size of checker board display the checkker board size   | To show how the option will work and show simulation
3.| the user can see the solution on auto mode, the user can able to place the queen at right place | in Auto mode, it show the number of solution, in amnual mode, the user can do the quiz/puzzle to find the solutions | To learn about multiple possible solutions.
4.| The user can clear and simulate again 	| Simulator show another solution | Learn how the n queen problem works
