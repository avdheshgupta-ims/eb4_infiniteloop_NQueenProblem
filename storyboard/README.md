## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: N Queen Problem
### 1. Story Outline:

This problem is to find an arrangement of N queens on a chess board, such that no queen can attack any other queens on the board.
The chess queens can attack in any direction as horizontal, vertical, horizontal and diagonal way.
A binary matrix is used to display the positions of N Queens, where no queens can attack other queens.

### 2. Story:

The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following are two solutions for 4 Queen problem.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
1. Stimulator Screen, divided into three parts.
2. The very first part to the left contains input part which is then subdivided into three parts.
3. First subdivided part contains Radio buttons for Modes selection.
4. Second subdivided part contains Radio buttons for Speed selection.
5. Third subdivided part contains drop down for Board size.
6. The second part of the stimulator contains output part which is then subdivided into two parts.
7. First subdivided part shows the no of solutions.
8. Second subdivided part shows the position of Queens.
9. The third part of the screen shows the stimulation of Queens on the board.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1. By this experiment, User will be able to explain Backtracking algorithm.
2. User will be able to describe Time Complexity
3. User will be able toanalyze the matrices.
4. User can be able to evaluate the place of queens in such a way that no queen attack each other


#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:
1. When the user will click on the simulator, simulator screen will be open up. The user will see three options on screen.
2. Firstly user will choose the size of board.
3. Then user will choose the mode of stimulation.
4. Then user will choose the speed of simulation.
5. According to the selction of mode stimulator will start to perform its action.
6. If manual mode is selected, user will have to solve the puzzle by placing queens.
7. If stimulation mde is selected, placement of queens will be started.
8. Then No. of solutions and position of Queens placed will be displayed.


##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Challenges:No queen should attack each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
Questions/Complexity/Variation:There can be multiple solutions, so we have to check all solutions.


##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
NA

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
